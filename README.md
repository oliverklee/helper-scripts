# Helper shell scripts for working with git, Linux and open source projects

This is a collection of helper scripts that reside in `~/bin`.

Each script has a short file header explaining its purpose.

The files ending in `.sh` are not intended to be called directly,
while the lowercase files without a `.sh` suffix are intended to be used as
commands.

I'll greatly appreciate pull requests that fix bugs or make the scripts more
readable.
