# Helper shell scripts for working with git, Linux and open source projects

This is a collection of helper scripts that reside in `~/bin`.

## Provided scripts

### Git helper scripts

These git helper scripts automatically detect the default branch (`main` or `master`)
and come with all kinds of safeguards.

| Script            | Description                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `pull`            | pulls the default branch                           |
| `upstream`        | keeps a git fork in sync                           |
| `upstream-10-4`   | like `upstream`, but with `10.4` as default branch |

### Linux helper scripts

Most of these scripts probably are Ubuntu-specific.

| Script            | Description                                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `fstrim-all`      | SSD-trims all ext partitions                          |
| `kwin-restart`    | restarts `kwin` (e.g., after a crash)                 |
| `memflush`        | flushes all memory caches and the swap file/partition |
| `package-cleanup` | purges all configured-but-not-installed packages      |
| `p55`â€¦`p81`       | switch `mod_php` and the CLI PHP to a that version    |

### Libraries included by the other scripts

| Library                   | Description                                            |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `colors.sh`               | defines the ANSI escape codes for colored shell output | 
| `git-tools.sh`            | provides functions for the git-related scripts         |
| `output.sh`               | provides functions for outputting status messages      |
